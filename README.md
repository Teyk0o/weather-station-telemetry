## 🚀 Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites
The system requires specific Arduino libraries to interface with the DHT22 sensor:
```bash
# Required Arduino Libraries
- DHT sensor library (Adafruit)
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
```

### Installation Process
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-station-telemetry.git
cd weather-station-telemetry
```

2. **Configure Arduino IDE**:
    - Load `mainWeatherStation.ino` as the primary file
    - Ensure all module files are in the same project directory
    - Verify that the Arduino IDE recognizes all tabs

3. **Install dependencies**:
    - Navigate to Library Manager in Arduino IDE
    - Search for "DHT sensor library" by Adafruit
    - Install both "DHT sensor library" and "Adafruit Unified Sensor"

4. **Hardware assembly** following the wiring diagram specifications

5. **Deploy and monitor**:
    - Compile and upload the complete system
    - Open Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate
    - Observe real-time telemetry JSON messages

## 📊 Telemetry Message Format

### Sensor Data Transmission
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1234567,
  "id": 42,
  "type": "sensor_data",
  "sensor_type": "temperature",
  "value": 23.5,
  "success": true
}
```

### Health Check Protocol
```
Ground → Station: ping
Station → Ground: pong
```

The ping-pong mechanism ensures bidirectional communication capability, which is critical for command reception verification in real space missions.

## 🛑 AI-Assisted Learning Methodology

This project was developed through an AI-assisted learning approach, where I used Claude AI as an interactive tutor to guide me through embedded systems engineering concepts and best practices. The collaboration followed a structured educational methodology where I was given exercises and challenges to solve independently, with the AI providing guidance, corrections, and explanations when needed.

**Learning Process:**
- I provided the initial project specification and learning objectives to establish clear educational goals
- The AI guided me through modular design principles and helped me understand aerospace industry standards through progressive exercises
- I wrote all code implementations myself, receiving feedback and corrections on my approaches after completing each module
- No code was copied directly from AI suggestions; instead, I learned underlying concepts and implemented solutions independently based on my understanding
- The AI served as a technical mentor, explaining why certain approaches were superior to others and helping me understand professional development practices used in mission-critical systems
- Each module was built upon previous learning, creating a comprehensive understanding of telemetry system architecture

**Educational Approach Benefits:**
This structured learning methodology allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of embedded systems architecture, sophisticated error handling strategies, and professional documentation practices while maintaining complete ownership of all implementation and design decisions. The AI assistance focused exclusively on teaching fundamental concepts and guiding problem-solving approaches rather than providing ready-made solutions, ensuring that every line of code and every architectural decision represents my own technical understanding and engineering judgment.

The iterative feedback process helped me understand not just what works, but why certain approaches are preferred in professional embedded systems development, particularly for mission-critical applications where reliability and maintainability are paramount concerns.
