# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Weather Station Telemetry System implements a three-tier modular architecture that separates concerns and facilitates maintenance, following aerospace industry best practices. This design enables independent testing of components, simplified debugging through isolation of functions, and straightforward expansion without requiring complete system rewrites.

## Architectural Principles

### Separation of Concerns
Each module maintains a single, well-defined responsibility, reducing complexity and improving maintainability. This approach mirrors the modular design philosophy used in mission-critical aerospace systems where component isolation prevents cascading failures.

### Defensive Programming
The system implements comprehensive error handling at every level, from individual sensor readings to complete communication failures. This defensive approach ensures the system can continue operating even when components fail partially or completely.

### Graceful Degradation
When failures occur, the system continues operating with reduced functionality rather than complete shutdown. For example, if the humidity sensor fails, the system continues providing temperature data while alerting the ground station to the partial failure.

## Module Architecture

### Sensor Module (`TemperatureAndHumiditySensor.ino`)

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Interface management for DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- Data validation against operational ranges (-50°C to +60°C, 0% to 100% RH)
- State management for individual sensor functions
- Error detection and reporting for sensor malfunctions

**Key Design Features:**
- Independent state tracking for temperature and humidity functions
- Range validation prevents transmission of physically impossible readings
- Structured return values provide both data and status information
- Graceful degradation allows partial operation when one sensor function fails

**Interface Specification:**
```cpp
// Initialization with comprehensive status reporting
initData initSensor();

// State query for runtime monitoring
initData getSensorState();

// Data acquisition with validation
data getSensorData(String dataType);
```

### Communication Module (`CommunicationModule.ino`)

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Serial communication initialization and maintenance
- Message formatting and transmission
- Communication health monitoring through ping-pong protocol
- Error detection and recovery for communication failures

**Key Design Features:**
- Robust initialization with timeout protection prevents infinite blocking
- JSON message formatting balances readability with structured data
- Bidirectional health checks ensure command reception capability
- Automatic buffer clearing prevents data contamination

**Protocol Specifications:**
- Baud Rate: 9600 bps (optimized for reliability over speed)
- Message Format: JSON with timestamp, ID, type, and data fields
- Health Check: Ping-pong verification every 15 seconds during idle periods
- Error Recovery: Automatic retry with progressive delays

### Main Coordination Program (`mainWeatherStation.ino`)

**Primary Responsibilities:**
- System orchestration and module coordination
- Initialization sequence management with retry logic
- Timing management for measurement and transmission cycles
- System-wide error handling and recovery strategies

**Key Design Features:**
- Retry logic with configurable attempt limits prevents infinite loops
- Independent timing management for different system functions
- Graceful handling of module initialization failures
- Adaptive operation based on available system capabilities

## Error Handling Strategy

### Three-Tier Error Management

**Level 1 - Component Level:**
Individual modules detect and handle their specific error conditions. Sensor modules validate readings against physical limits, while communication modules verify transmission success.

**Level 2 - System Level:**
The main program coordinates recovery efforts and makes decisions about system operation based on component status. This includes retry logic and graceful degradation decisions.

**Level 3 - Mission Level:**
The system continues operating with reduced capability when complete recovery is not possible, maintaining maximum scientific value from available resources.

### Retry Logic Implementation

```cpp
// Example retry pattern used throughout the system
int attempts = 1;
while (!success && (attempts < MAX_RETRIES)) {
    attempts++;
    success = attemptOperation();
    if (!success) {
        delay(RETRY_DELAY_MS);
    }
}
```

## Timing and Scheduling

### Measurement Cycle
- **Frequency:** Every 30 seconds
- **Duration:** Approximately 290ms per complete cycle
- **Components:** Sensor reading (250ms), validation (5ms), formatting (15ms), transmission (20ms)

### Health Monitoring
- **Frequency:** Every 15 seconds during measurement intervals
- **Timeout:** 15-second maximum wait for ping-pong response
- **Recovery:** Automatic communication module reinitialization on failure

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage:** Less than 1% during normal operation
- **Memory Usage:** Approximately 650 bytes SRAM (32% of Arduino Uno capacity)
- **Flash Usage:** Approximately 8.5KB (26% of Arduino Uno capacity)

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Expansion
The modular architecture facilitates addition of new sensor types by creating additional sensor modules that follow the same interface pattern. Each new sensor module maintains its own state and validation logic.

### Vertical Enhancement
Communication protocols can be enhanced without affecting sensor modules. Migration from JSON to binary protocols requires changes only in the communication module and main program coordination logic.

### Performance Optimization
The current implementation provides ample headroom for optimization. Future enhancements could include data compression, encryption, or local buffering without requiring architectural changes.

## Security Architecture

### Current Implementation
- Input validation prevents buffer overflows and data corruption
- Range checking prevents injection of invalid sensor readings
- Structured error reporting facilitates security monitoring

### Future Enhancements
- Encryption layer for sensitive data transmission
- Authentication mechanisms for command reception
- Tamper detection for sensor integrity monitoring

## Maintenance and Testing Strategy

### Component Isolation
Each module can be tested independently using standardized test fixtures. This isolation simplifies debugging and validation during development and maintenance phases.

### Interface Standardization
Consistent data structures and error reporting patterns across modules enable automated testing and monitoring systems to verify correct operation.

### Documentation Integration
Code comments and documentation maintain synchronization through regular review cycles, ensuring accuracy and completeness of technical documentation.
